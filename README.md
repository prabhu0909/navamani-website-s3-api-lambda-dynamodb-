## Setup Instructions

### 1. S3 Static Website Hosting

- Create an S3 bucket (e.g., `navamani-site01`)
- Enable **Static Website Hosting** on the bucket
- Upload the website files (HTML, CSS, JS, images)
- Set bucket policy for public read access to website content

### 2. Upload Images

- Upload all images to the `/images/` folder in the S3 bucket  
- Reference images using their S3 public URLs in your HTML

### 3. DynamoDB Table

- Create a DynamoDB table (e.g., `NavamaniContacts`)  
- Use a string primary key `id`

### 4. AWS Lambda Function

- Create a Lambda function with appropriate permissions to write to DynamoDB  
- Use the provided Lambda handler code to process contact submissions

### 5. API Gateway

- Create an API Gateway HTTP or REST API  
- Create a POST `/contact` endpoint integrated with the Lambda function  
- Enable CORS to allow browser requests from your S3 website domain  
- Deploy the API and note the invoke URL

### 6. Configure Website Contact Form

- Update the contact form fetch URL to your API Gateway endpoint  
- Test sending messages from the website

## Important Notes
Ensure IAM Roles attached to Lambda have DynamoDB write permissions.

Make sure CORS is properly configured on API Gateway to allow your website domain.

Secure your AWS resources; consider validation, throttling, and monitoring.

Customize the styles and images as per your branding needs.
